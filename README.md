Star Trek

In the early 1970's my brother was attending the Univeristy of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and there on the campus was a computer lab with a bunch teletype terminals. Of course, there were games you could play using the teletype terminals. One of those games I played was Star Trek. But I wasn't happy just playing, I wanted to see the code, so I used the LIST command to obtain a listing of the Star Trek BASIC program. 

A few years later, I used that listing to create a COBOL version of Star Trek which ran on a Honeywell 200 Model 115 and, conveniently, had a teletype console. Over the years, the COBOl program was enhanced and provided hours of entertainment on serveral different computer systems. The original BASIC listing and COBOL programs inspired by it have long since been lost, but not forgotten.

This incarnation of my Star Trek teletype program is written in C.

Although I have no idea as to the author of that Star Trek BASIC program from long ago, I credit [STAR TREK: BY MIKE MAYFIELD, CENTERLINE ENGINEERING](https://simplesi.net/original-star-trek-game-mike-mayfield-1972-version/) as the inspiration for my Star Trek games.
